# damn-vulnerable-defi
Part three of my Solidity and smart contracts learning journey, solving challenges !

## Previously...

Taking up the [Ethernaut](https://github.com/Krow10/ethernaut-challs) and [Capture the Ether](https://github.com/Krow10/capture-the-ether-challs) challenges tought me a lot about smart contracts security and Solidity/EVM tricks. It took me around a week to finish each one. However, I expect these challs to be a bit more demanding in terms of blockchain, EVM and DeFi protocol knowledge. 

## Why ?

The increase in difficulty comes with the added benefit of interacting with less common or more subtle vulnerabilities which is great for being more efficient during security audits of smart contracts. The more you encounter, the more you're being aware and pay attention to certain patterns that could indicate severe flaws in the code.

Also certain challs requires you to be familiar and learn about some widely used protocols such as Uniswap, flash loans, NFTs, etc...

## What ?

All solutions can be found in the *test* folder, inside the `Exploit` test function and in the *contracts/attacker-contracts* folder. Took me around 5 full days to solve them all and learned quite a lot during this time about Uniswap, Flash loans, Gnosis safes, etc.

## Next ?

Start reading smart contracts audits and figure out the vulnerabilities by myself. Get more familiar with hardhat and start to fork mainnet/testnet for replaying vulnerabilites.
